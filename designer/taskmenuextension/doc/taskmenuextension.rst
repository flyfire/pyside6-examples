Task Menu Extension (Designer)
==============================

This example shows how to add custom widgets to Qt Designer,
which can be launched with `pyside6-designer`, and to extend
its built-in context menu.

The main mechanism is based on the :ref:`QPyDesignerCustomWidgetCollection`
class that takes care of handling the registration.

More information can be found in :ref:`designer_custom_widgets`.
