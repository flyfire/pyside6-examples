Surface Example
===============

Using Q3DSurface in a widget application.

The surface example shows how to make a simple 3D surface graph using
Q3DSurface and combining the use of widgets for adjusting several adjustable
qualities. This example demonstrates the following features:

* How to set up a basic QSurfaceDataProxy and set data for it.
* How to use QHeightMapSurfaceDataProxy for showing 3D height maps.
* Three different selection modes for studying the graph.
* Axis range usage for displaying selected portions of the graph.
* Changing theme.
* How to set a custom surface gradient.

For instructions about how to interact with the graph, see `this page`_.
