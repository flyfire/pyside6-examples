Basic Drawing Example
=====================

The Basic Drawing example shows how to display basic graphics primitives in
a variety of styles using the QPainter class.

QPainter performs low-level painting on widgets and other paint devices. The
class can draw everything from simple lines to complex shapes like pies and
chords. It can also draw aligned text and pixmaps. Normally, it draws in
a "natural" coordinate system, but it can in addition do view and world
transformation.
